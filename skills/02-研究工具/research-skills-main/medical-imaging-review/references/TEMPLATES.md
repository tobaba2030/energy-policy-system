# [Topic] Literature Review Writing Guidelines

## Project info
- **Topic**: [specific topic]
- **Target journals**: [Tier 1: e.g., Nat Rev Cardiol] / [Tier 2: e.g., JACC Cardiovasc Imaging] / [Tier 3: e.g., Eur Radiol]
- **Paradigm spec**: see PARADIGM.md (Phase 0 output)
- **Citation integrity**: see references/CITATION_INTEGRITY.md
- **Hallucination self-check**: see references/HALLUCINATION_PATTERNS.md

## Terminology Standardization

| Unified Term | Avoid Using |
|---|---|
| coronary CT angiography (CCTA) | cardiac CT, CT angio, CTA (ambiguous) |
| centerline (anatomical structure) | midline, vessel line |
| [add domain-specific terms] | [variants to avoid] |

## Canonical Paper / Dataset Descriptions

To prevent internal inconsistency (HALLUCINATION_PATTERNS.md ▸ Pattern 9), lock in canonical descriptions:

| Paper / Dataset | Canonical description |
|---|---|
| ImageCAS | 1000 cases, single-center, CCTA artery segmentation |
| TransCC (Xu et al.) | 3 authors: Chenchu Xu, Meng Li, Xue Wu; Dice 0.730 / IoU 0.582 on ImageCAS |
| FISH&CHIPS | NHS national CT-FFR implementation program; publication: Fairbairn TA et al. Nat Med 2025;31(6):1903-1910 |
| [add high-value papers] | [verified description] |

## Standard Table Templates

### Table 1: Public Datasets

```markdown
**Table 1 | Public datasets for [task].**

| Dataset | Year | Cases | Annotation type | Access |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Name] | 20XX | N | [type] | [link] |

*Cases = unique patients. Where multi-center, the number of sites is given in parentheses. Access notations: O = open, R = restricted (registration), C = commercial.*
```

### Table 2: Method Comparison

```markdown
**Table 2 | Representative deep learning methods for [task].**

| Reference | Modality | Family | Architecture | Dataset | Headline metric | Innovation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [First-author Year] [N] | CCTA | Topology-aware | nnU-Net + clDice | ImageCAS | Dice 0.812 | First clDice on CCTA |

*Performance numbers are taken from the original publications and should not be compared directly across rows; datasets, splits and metric definitions differ. Family is the most-engaged inductive prior or training regime, not the only one. CCTA = coronary CT angiography; HD95 = 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance; — = not reported.*
```

### Table 3: Commercial Products

```markdown
**Table 3 | Commercial AI tools for [domain] with regulatory clearance.**

| Manufacturer | Product | Indication | Underlying technology | Regulatory | Deployment | Key validation evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HeartFlow | CT-FFR Analysis | CT-FFR | CFD + DL hybrid | FDA cleared (CPT 75580); CE | Cloud-based SaaS | NXT, ADVANCE, PLATFORM, PACIFIC; FISH&CHIPS [N] |
| Keya Medical | DeepVessel FFR | CT-FFR | DL surrogate of CFD | FDA, NMPA Class III, CE | Cloud + on-site | Multi-centre Chinese validation [N] |

*Listed validation evidence refers to peer-reviewed primary publications, not vendor white papers. NMPA = National Medical Products Administration (China); CFD = computational fluid dynamics.*

## Notes

### Why bibliography target removed

v2 set "80-120 references" as a quality criterion. This drove Claude to **pad the bibliography**, and padding encouraged fabrication. v3 has no count target. Cite what supports the argument. If your review naturally has 60 high-quality refs, that's enough. If it needs 150, also fine. Quantity is downstream of substance.

### Why 3-axis Methods is the structural commitment

v2's coronary review produced 10 flat method H3 subsections. The resulting §Methods read as a textbook chapter, not a flagship review. Flagship reviews compress 10+ method variants into ~3 thematic axes that force comparative synthesis. The 3-axis structure is the most important structural fix in v3.
